## âš¡ How It Works
1. When the app starts, your portfolio is loaded from **Hive storage**.  
2. Prices are fetched from the **CoinGecko API**.  
3. The **Portfolio screen** shows:
   - Total Portfolio Value  
   - List of added cryptocurrencies with quantity, price, and total value  
4. You can:
   - **Add new coins** from the list (quantity dialog included)  
   - **Swipe to delete** coins  
   - **Refresh manually** (pull-to-refresh) or let it **auto-update every 90 seconds**
